Subject: Request for OAuth App Approval - StudyBuddy Application

Dear IT Administrator,

I am developing an educational application called StudyBuddy that integrates with Google Classroom to help students with their assignments. The application requires access to Google Classroom data to provide AI-powered study assistance.

To enable this functionality for our school domain accounts, I need the following OAuth configuration approved:

**Application Details:**
- Application Name: StudyBuddy
- OAuth Client ID: 700180410067-93e6ftc1pnhdig04r3mjcppnci159d15.apps.googleusercontent.com
- Developer: everett.hurder@gmail.com

**Required API Scopes:**
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email (basic profile)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile (basic profile) 
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly (view classroom courses)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.me (view student's coursework)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.students.readonly (view coursework)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.rosters.readonly (view class rosters)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.student-submissions.me.readonly (view submissions)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courseworkmaterials.readonly (view course materials)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly (read-only access to attached documents)

**What the app does:**
- Reads Google Classroom assignments and materials
- Downloads attached documents (with read-only access)
- Provides AI-powered study assistance based on assignment content
- Does NOT modify, delete, or share any data
- All processing is done locally/privately

**Security Notes:**
- The app only requests read-only permissions
- No data is stored permanently or shared with third parties
- Students maintain full control over their data

Could you please add this OAuth client to the approved applications list and enable the required scopes for our domain?

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Student ID/Email]
